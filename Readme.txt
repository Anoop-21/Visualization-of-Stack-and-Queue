Visualisation of Stack and Queue using GLUT

This program demonstrates the visualization of stack and queue data structures using OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library. It allows users to perform basic stack and queue operations such as push, pop, enqueue and dequeue, and displays the updated data structure graphically.

Requirements:

C++ compiler
OpenGL library
GLUT library
Instructions:

Download the source code files from the provided repository.

Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example, using g++ compiler in Linux:
g++ stack_queue_visualization.cpp -o stack_queue_visualization -lGL -lGLU -lglut

Run the executable file:
./stack&queue.cpp


The program will display two windows, one for the stack and one for the queue. The initial data structures are empty.

To perform operations on the stack, instructions will be  given at the time of execution.
.


Note:

The maximum size of the stack and queue can be set by modifying the constant values defined in the source code.
The graphical representation of the data structures may vary depending on the screen resolution and window size.
Enjoy using the Stack and Queue visualization program!




Additionally ,Executing The fact.cpp we know use stack applications for calculating factorial of number.
